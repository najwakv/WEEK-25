//Tree is a non-linear ds that consist of nodes connected by edges.
//quicker and easier access to the data.
//do not conatin any loop or cycle.
//tree usage 
//1.File system for directory structure
//2.A family tree
//3.An organisation tree
//4.DOM
//5.Chat bots
//6.Abstract syntax tree
//Parent node = A node which is immediate predecessor of another node
//Child node = A node which is immediate successor of another node
//Root-node = The node from which the tree orginates
//root node doesnt have a parent node
//Leaf-nodes = nodes that doesnt have any child node
//Siblings = Nodes with same parent
//Ancestor-node = The node is a parents parent.
//Path = The sequence of nodes and edges from one node to aniother.
//Distance = Which is the number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.
//Degree-of-node = Total number pf child nodes it has.
//Degree-of-a-tree = maximum degree of a node in the tree.
//Depth = number of edges from the root to that node
//Depth of root node is always zero
//Height = Number of edges from the deepest leaf to that node
//Height of the root-node is considered as the height of the tree
